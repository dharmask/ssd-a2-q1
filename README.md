# SSD A2 — Q1 (GitHub Pages Ready)

This repo contains a plain HTML profile page for **vadla shiva kishan** (no CSS/JS as per Q1 constraints).

## How to Publish (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a repo on your GitHub account `dharmask` named **ssd-a2-q1**.
2. Put these files at the repo root (index.html at the top-level, `assets/` alongside it).
3. Commit & push to the `main` branch.
4. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**
   - Source: *Deploy from a branch*
   - Branch: `main` / root (`/`)
5. After it builds, your site URL will be:

   **https://dharmask.github.io/ssd-a2-q1/**

> If you prefer a user site instead, create a repo named **dharmask.github.io** and put the same files there. The URL will then be **https://dharmask.github.io/**

## Privacy
